					<h2>About this App</h2>
					<p>This app is an early version of my scoring system that I believe will be useful for my organization's open recruitment. We can add players, add events, and add rounds for each event, where we can give a score to each round for each player. I made this app to learn React with React Router and Zustand. It starts great until I start making SQL relations on Javascript arrays. In this app, you won't send any data to any backend because every submission is only stored in the zustand store.</p>
